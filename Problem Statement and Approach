Problem Statement: 

Initial:
Repetitive efforts and time is spent on searching for new visualizations to create Tableau dashboards.

Final:
A Tableau workbook is present, which serves as a go to repository for any visualizations required

Questions:
1) What are the type of graphs required?
2) What are the use case for each visualization?
3) What are the limitations and advantages of each visualization?

Approach:

Data preparation:
Dummy clean data was created for each visualization created

Dashboard creation:
1) The pen and paper version of each visualization was created
2) The visualization was recreated in Tableau
3) The use cases, limitations and advantages were displayed under the visualizations
4) The end to end Quality check (QC) of the dashboard was done

Consumption:
The dashboard was shared with the client. This was used by the client for their presentations and projects. Also, it was shared with other teams of Mu Sigma for its usage.

Next Steps:
Every month, 8 hours of time of 2 resources was set aside to add new visualizations to the dashboard

Major Learnings:
1) The use cases of different visualizations
2) The technicalities of creating visualizations in Tableau
